Abstract
========
  
**Importance.**  Hearing loss is a heterogeneous disorder thought to affect brain reorganization across the lifespan. The exact structural endophenotype of hearing loss is not known, although it is assumed to affect the auditory regions of the temporal lobe such as Heschl's gyrus.  
  
**Objective.**  Here we assessed the structural alterations of hearing loss by using a meta-analysis of effect size measures based on MNI coordinate mapping of MRI studies. Unique effect size metrics based on Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g were created to map coordinates of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) alterations from bilateral congenital and acquired hearing loss populations. Three coordinate mapping techniques were used and compared: coordinate-based anatomic likelihood estimation (ALE), multi-level kernel density analysis (mKDA), and seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Using a meta-regression, GM and WM trajectories were mapped to visualize the progression of congenital and acquired hearing loss throughout the lifespan. Heterogeneity in effect size metrics was determined using the forest, Baujat, Funnel, Galbraith and bubble plots to discern dispersion and spread of datapoints. Lastly, we displayed an endophenotype map of hearing loss alterations in GM and WM obtained from a multivariable meta-regression of the effect size.  
  
**Data Sources.** PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus primary and secondary literature was searched from inception to May 2020, augmented by expert recommendations, grey searchers, and primary literature citation inclusions.  
  
**Study Selection.** Any peer-reviewed publication irrespective of language that involved the structural neuroimaging of the human brain in participants with hearing loss at any age.   
  
**Data Extraction and Synthesis.**  Data was collected on 1) October 10th, 2012 through November 1st, 2012, 2) June 6th through July 20th 2018, 3) directly prior to publication following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses. Results were summarized across studies in a random-effects model.      
**Main Outcomes and Measures.** Effect sizes for GM and WM metrics associated with hearing loss in structural MNI coordinates were used for the outcome measure.   
  
**Results.** The systematic review and meta-analysis revealed n = 72 studies with structural alterations measured by MRI (bilateral=64, unilateral=8). The bilateral studies contained more than  66,545 variable datapoint metrics broadly categorizing hearing loss into congenital and acquired cases from mild to profound impact (n = 7445) and control cases (n = 2924) with ages of 34.92 ± 23.08 and 30.61 ± 19.45 years, respectively. We found hearing loss affects GM and underlying WM in nearly every region of the brain. In congenital hearing loss, GM decreased most in the frontal lobe. Acquired hearing loss similarly had a decrease in frontal lobe GM, albeit the insula was most decreased. Congenital white matter underlying the frontal lobe GM was most decreased. The temporal lobe had different GM alterations in congenital and acquired, decreasing in the former and increasing in the latter, possibly due to age-dependent compensation. The WM alterations most frequently underlined GM alterations in congenital hearing loss, while acquired hearing loss studies did not assess the WM metric frequently.

**Limitations.** There were several limitations of neuroimaging studies in the hearing loss field with manuscripts many for example not reporting mean and SD for GM or WM metrics, lack of MNI coordinates, and some not reporting sufficient control populations. These factors could have contributed to heterogeneity as underlying explanatory variables.

**Conclusions and Relevance.**  Although temporal lobe auditory regions are most commonly thought to be affected in hearing loss, the present analysis found the frontal lobe gray matter and underlying white matter most decreased in both congenital and acquired hearing loss. The present study demonstrates hearing loss across the lifespan and the compensatory adaptations which occur to the brain due to lack of auditory input. This meta-analysis review presents a novel ‘hit-enter’ repeatability format for assessing hearing loss, providing all data, scripts and analysis from data curation to visualization available for reproducibility. Future studies should use the endophenotype of hearing loss as a prognostic template for discerning impact and clinical outcomes.

==================
Hearing loss is a heterogeneous disorder thought to affect brain reorganization across the lifespan. The exact structural endophenotype of hearing loss is not known, although it is assumed to affect the auditory regions of the temporal lobe such as Heschl's gyrus. Here we assessed the structural alterations of hearing loss by using a meta-analysis of effect size measures based on MNI coordinate mapping of MRI studies. Unique effect size metrics based on Cohen’s d and Hedges’ g were created to map coordinates of gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) alterations from bilateral congenital and acquired hearing loss populations. Three mapping techniques were used and compared: coordinate-based anatomic likelihood estimation (ALE), multi-level kernel density analysis (mKDA), and seed-based d Mapping (SDM). Using a meta-regression, GM and WM trajectories were mapped to visualize the progression of hearing loss throughout the lifespan. Heterogeneity in effect size metrics was determined using the forest, Baujat, Funnel, Galbraith and bubble plots to discern dispersion and spread of datapoints. Lastly, we displayed an endophenotype map of hearing loss alterations in GM and WM obtained from a multivariable meta-regression of the effect size. The systematic review and meta-analysis revealed n = 72 studies with structural alterations measured with MRI (bilateral=64, unilateral=8). The bilateral studies contained more than 28000 variable datapoint metrics broadly categorizing hearing loss into congenital and acquired cases (n = 7445) and control cases (n = 2924) with ages of 34.92 ± 23.08 and 30.61 ± 19.45 years, respectively. We found hearing loss affects GM and underlying WM in nearly every region of the brain. In congenital hearing loss, GM decreased most in the frontal lobe. Acquired hearing loss similarly had a decrease in frontal lobe GM, albeit the insula was most decreased. Congenital white matter underlying the frontal lobe GM was most decreased. The temporal lobe had different GM alterations in congenital and acquired, decreasing in the former and increasing in the latter. The WM alterations most frequently underlined GM alterations in congenital hearing loss, while acquired hearing loss studies did not assess the WM metric frequently. There were several limitations of studies in the hearing loss field with manuscripts for example not reporting mean and SD for GM or WM metrics, lack of MNI coordinates, and some not reporting sufficient control populations. These factors could have contributed to heterogeneity as underlying explanatory variables. The present article presents a novel ‘hit-enter’ repeatability format for assessing hearing loss, providing all data, scripts and analysis from data curation to visualization available for reproducibility.
